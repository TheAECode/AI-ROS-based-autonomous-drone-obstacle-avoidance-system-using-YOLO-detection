# System Architecture Document

## Design Philosophy

The system follows a modular, distributed architecture enabling:
- Real-time performance with deterministic latency
- Fault tolerance through isolated component failure
- Scalable processing pipeline for future enhancements
- Clean separation of concerns across functional domains

## Component Architecture

### Layered Design Approach

**Perception Layer**
- Hardware abstraction for camera interface
- Image preprocessing and format conversion
- Frame buffering and synchronization

**Processing Layer**
- AI inference engine with GPU acceleration
- Object detection and classification algorithms
- Confidence scoring and validation logic

**Decision Layer**
- Threat assessment and proximity evaluation
- Path planning and avoidance strategy generation
- Mission state management and preservation

**Control Layer**
- Flight controller communication interface
- Mode switching and command translation
- Safety monitoring and fail-safe implementation

**Monitoring Layer**
- System health diagnostics
- Performance metric collection
- Real-time status visualization

## Inter-Process Communication

### ROS Topic Architecture
- **/camera/color/image_raw**: RGB image stream from RealSense
- **/yolo/detections**: Object detection results with bounding boxes
- **/drone/obstacle_status**: Obstacle assessment and threat level
- **/cmd_vel**: Velocity commands for avoidance maneuvers
- **/mavros/state**: Flight controller status and mode information

### Message Flow Design
